# Directives

Directives are Attributes that define a transformation that needs to happen within the widget during build time. A great example of this would be the `TextDirective` which allow to define the text case, for your `TextMix` widget.

```dart highlight="2"
final style = Mix(
  upperCase(),
);

const TextMix('Open', mix: style),
```

In the above example the text `Open` becomes `OPEN`
