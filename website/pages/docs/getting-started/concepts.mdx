# Core Concepts

This section defines _Mix_ `Attributes` and the `Utilities` that can be used to create them.

## Attributes & Utilities

`Attributes` are the foundation for visual characteristics and properties that can be defined and added to a _Mix_.

In _Flutter_ we say:

> Everything is a widget

In _Mix_, we say:

> Everything is an Attribute

**Note: In this document, a _Mix_ is an object that contains a collection of `Attributes`.**

#### Utilities

To facilitate interacting with `Attributes`, we use `Utility` functions. These functions allow more control over how an attribute is composed.

Consider the following example:

```dart
Mix(height(100));
```

This defines a _Mix_ with the box height attribute of _100_.
The function `height()` is a `Utility` that allows us to compose an `Attribute`.

**Note: The above example is a actually a shortcut for the following expression:**

```dart
height(double value) => BoxAttribute(height: value);
```

With that in mind you can think of the following equivalency:

```dart
Mix(height(100))
// is equivalent to
Mix(BoxAttribute(height: 100))
```

As you can see, `Utilities` are not required for composing _Mixes_. However, they make a cleaner API possible, and an overall better development experience.

## Mixable Widgets

The _Mix_ package defines a set of widget primitives that can use _Mix_ `Attributes` and allow them to be rendered with those `Attributes`.

At first glance it might seem these widgets are doing a lot &mdash; in reality, they are simply wrapping basic _Flutter_ widgets and allowing their visual properties to be defined through a _Mix._

The fundamental widget primitive defined in _Mix_ is a `Box`. A `Box` can contain other widgets and a set of `BoxAttributes` to define it's visual properties.

> An easy misconception would be to think that `Box` is **like** a `Container`, but that would be incorrect: `Box` **is** a `Container`.

That means that this:

```dart
Box(mix:Mix(height(100)));
```

will become the following:

```dart
Container(height: 100);
```

You can think of `Utilities` as shortcuts to defining visual properties. Thus:

```dart
Box(mix:Mix(rounded(100)));
```

will become the following:

```dart
Container(
  decoration: BoxDecoration(
    borderRadius: BorderRadius.all(
      Radius.circular(10),
    ),
  ),
)
```
