# Core Concepts

## Attributes & Utilities

Attributes are the foundation for visual characteristics and properties, that can be defined and added to a Mix. In Flutter we say "Everything is a widget", so in Mix.

> Everything is an Attribute

To make interaction with `Attributes` easier we have `Utility` functions. That allow for more control over how an attribute is composed.

Lets take the following example.

```dart
Mix(height(100));
```


This is defining a Mix with the box height attribute of _100_.
However `height()` is a `Utility` that allows us to compose an `Attribute`.

**Similar to this**

```dart
height(double value) => BoxAttribute(height: value);
```

With that in mind you can think of the following being equivalent.

```dart
Mix(height(100))
// is equivalent to
Mix(BoxAttribute(height: 100))
```

As you can see `Utilities` are not required for comsing Mixes however, make a cleaner API possible and overall better development experience.

## Mixable Widgets

These are the widget primitives that allow a Mix to be rendered. At first sight it might look like these widgets are doing a lot, however they are just wrapping basic Flutter widgets and allowing their visual properties to be defined through a Mix.

The most basic widget primitive. `Box` is not like a `Container`, "Box is a Container". That means you can think of all `BoxAttributes` as Container properties.

> You might think Box is like a Container, but that would be wrong. Box is a Container.

That means that this:

```dart
Box(mix:Mix(height(100)));
```

will become the following

```dart
Container(height: 100);
```

You can start to think as `Utilities` as shortcuts to defining visual properties.

```dart
Box(mix:Mix(rounded(100)));
```

will become the following

```dart
Container(
  decoration: BoxDecoration(
    borderRadius: BorderRadius.all(
      Radius.circular(10),
    ),
  ),
)
```
