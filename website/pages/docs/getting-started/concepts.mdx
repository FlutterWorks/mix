# Concepts

## Attributes & Utilities

Attributes are the foundation for visual characteristics and properties, that can be defined and added to a Mix. In Flutter we say "Everything is a widget", so in Mix.

> Everything is an Attribute

To make interaction with `Attributes` easier we have `Utility` functions. That allow for more control over how an attribute is composed.

Lets take the following example.

<Code>
{`Mix(height(100));`}
</Code>

This is defining a Mix with the box height attribute of *100*.
However `height()` is a `Utility` that allows us to compose an `Attribute`.

**Similar to this**

<Code>
{`
BoxAttribute height(double value) => BoxAttribute(height: value);
`}
</Code>

With that in mind you can think of the following being equivalent.

<Code>
{`
Mix(height(100))
// is equivalent to
Mix(BoxAttribute(height: 100))
`}
</Code>

As you can see `Utilities` are not required for comsing Mixes however, make a cleaner API possible and overall better development experience.
## Mixer Widgets

The widget primitives that allow to render a Mix. They are the following:

### Box

The most basic widget primitive. `Box` is not like a `Container`, Box is a Container". That means you can think of all `BoxAttributes` as `Container` properties.

That means that this:

<Code>
{`
Box(mix:Mix(height(100)));
`}
</Code>

will be translated into

<Code>
{`
Container(height: 100);
`}
</Code>


### Variants

These are variations of a Mix.

## Directives

## Decorators

## Theme

## Tokens
