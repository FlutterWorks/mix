# Supporting new Widgets

Mix is a powerful tool and to make it even more powerful, we can add support for new widgets and increase its functionality for more and more cases. Therefore, This is a guide to help you to add support for new widgets.

To make this tutorial more real, we will add support for a widget from **Material**, the TextField. To be more specific, we will add support for the `decoration` attribute, that defines the most of the visual aspects of the TextField, and as result, we will be able to go from the default TextField, that looks like this:

and make it look like this:

## 1. Define the Spec

As we are adding support for a new widget and its own attributes you want to customize, we need to define the spec for it. The spec is a object that defines the attributes that the widget has and how to handle them. The spec for the `InputDecoration` is:

```dart
class InputDecorationSpec extends Spec<InputDecorationSpec> {
  final InputBorder? border;
  final bool? filled;
  final Color? fillColor;
  final EdgeInsetsGeometry? contentPadding;

  const InputDecorationSpec({
    this.border,
    this.filled,
    this.fillColor,
    this.contentPadding,
  });

  const InputDecorationSpec.empty()
      : border = null,
        filled = null,
        fillColor = null,
        contentPadding = null;

  static InputDecorationSpec of(BuildContext context) {
    final mix = MixProvider.of(context);
    return mix.attributeOf<InputDecorationSpecAttribute>()?.resolve(mix) ??
        const InputDecorationSpec.empty();
  }

  @override
  InputDecorationSpec lerp(InputDecorationSpec? other, double t) {
    return InputDecorationSpec(
      border: other?.border,
      filled: t < 0.5 ? filled : other?.filled,
      fillColor: Color.lerp(fillColor, other?.fillColor, t),
      contentPadding: EdgeInsetsGeometry.lerp(
        contentPadding,
        other?.contentPadding,
        t,
      ),
    );
  }

  InputDecorationSpec copyWith({
    InputBorder? border,
    bool? filled,
    Color? fillColor,
    EdgeInsetsGeometry? contentPadding,
  }) {
    return InputDecorationSpec(
      border: border ?? this.border,
      filled: filled ?? this.filled,
      fillColor: fillColor ?? this.fillColor,
      contentPadding: contentPadding ?? this.contentPadding,
    );
  }

  @override
  get props => [
        border,
        filled,
        fillColor,
        contentPadding,
      ];
}
```

at first look, it may look a little bit complex, but it's not. The `InputDecorationSpec` is a class that extends `Spec` and has a constructor that receives the attributes that the `InputDecoration` has, for this example I chose just four, the `border`, `filled`, `fillColor` and `contentPadding`. However for a real implementation, you should add all the attributes that the `InputDecoration` has.

Looking at the rest of the class, you can see the named constructor `empty`, that returns a default implementation of the `InputDecorationSpec`, the `of` method that receives a `MixData` and returns a `InputDecorationSpec` with the values of the `MixData`. The `lerp` method is used to interpolate between two `InputDecorationSpec`.

The Spec is the base of the support for a new widget and its attributes.

## 2. Create the Attribute

The attribute is the class that will be used to handle the `InputDecorationSpec`. The `InputDecorationSpecAttribute` is:

```dart
class InputDecorationSpecAttribute extends SpecAttribute<InputDecorationSpec> {
  final InputBorder? border;
  final bool? filled;
  final ColorDto? fillColor;
  final SpacingDto? contentPadding;

  const InputDecorationSpecAttribute({
    this.border,
    this.filled,
    this.fillColor,
    this.contentPadding,
  });

  @override
  InputDecorationSpec resolve(MixData mix) {
    return InputDecorationSpec(
      border: border,
      filled: filled,
      fillColor: fillColor?.resolve(mix),
      contentPadding: contentPadding?.resolve(mix),
    );
  }

  @override
  InputDecorationSpecAttribute merge(
      covariant InputDecorationSpecAttribute? other) {
    if (other == null) return this;

    return InputDecorationSpecAttribute(
      border: other.border ?? border,
      filled: other.filled ?? filled,
      fillColor: other.fillColor ?? fillColor,
      contentPadding: other.contentPadding ?? contentPadding,
    );
  }

  @override
  get props => [
        border,
        filled,
        fillColor,
        contentPadding,
      ];
}

```

Looking at its properties definition, you will see some changes in the property types, for example, now `fillColor` is a `ColorDto` and `contentPadding` is a `SpacingDto`, it's because the Mix uses a `Dto` classes to handle more complex types and supply some facilities to use them.

The `InputDecorationSpecAttribute` is a class that extends `SpecAttribute` and has a method `resolve` that is a useful method to transform the `InputDecorationSpec` from the `MixData`. The `merge` method is used to merge two different declarations of the `InputDecorationSpecAttribute`, a good example of this is:

```dart
final style = Style(
    InputDecorationSpecAttribute(
      border: OutlineInputBorder(),
      fillColor: ColorDto(Colors.blue),
      filled: true,
    ),
    InputDecorationSpecAttribute(
      fillColor: ColorDto(Colors.red),
      contentPadding: SpacingDto.only(top: 10),
    ),
)
```

In this case, the `style` will have the `border` and `filled` from the first declaration, and the `fillColor` and `contentPadding` from the second declaration. be aware that the second declaration of `fillColor` will override the first one, so the final `InputDecorationSpec` will have the `fillColor` as `Colors.red`.

## 3. Build the Custom Widget

The custom widget is the widget that will use the `InputDecorationSpec` to build the widget. It's a class that has a `SpecBuilder` in its composition. For this example, the `CustomTextField` is:

```dart
class StyledTextField extends StyledWidget {
  const StyledTextField({
    super.key,
    super.style,
    super.orderOfModifiers = const [],
  });

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return SpecBuilder(
      style: style,
      orderOfModifiers: orderOfModifiers,
      builder: (context) {
        final inputDecoration = InputDecorationSpec.of(context);

        return TextField(
          decoration: InputDecoration(
            border: inputDecoration.border,
            filled: inputDecoration.filled,
            fillColor: inputDecoration.fillColor,
            contentPadding: inputDecoration.contentPadding,
          ),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

The `SpecBuilder` is a class that extends `StyledWidget`. The `build` method uses the `withMix` method to transform the style received from StyledTextField to a `MixData`, it also verify if exist some inheritable attributes from the parent widgets, but it's just happen if the `inherit` property is `true`. With the `MixData` instance in hands, you can use the `InputDecorationSpec.of` method to get the `InputDecorationSpec` from the `MixData`, now you are able to apply the `InputDecorationSpec` to the `TextField` and return it.

Now you already ready to use the `StyledTextField` in your app and customize the `InputDecoration` of the `TextField` with Mix.

```dart
final style = Style(
  InputDecorationSpecAttribute(
    border: OutlineInputBorder(
                borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20),
                borderSide: BorderSide.none,
            ),
    fillColor: ColorDto(Colors.blueAccent.shade200),
    filled: true,
    contentPadding: SpacingDto.all(24),
  ),
);
```

## 4. Create the Utility

In the last step, we mentioned that you're ready to use the `StyledTextField` in your app, which is true. However, there's an opportunity to enhance its usability further. By creating a utility, you can simplify the process of applying attributes to the `InputDecoration`, making it even more convenient to customize your text fields.

```dart
class InputDecorationUtility<T extends Attribute>
    extends SpecUtility<T, InputDecorationSpecAttribute> {
  InputDecorationUtility(super.builder);

  @override
  T only({
    InputBorder? border,
    bool? filled,
    ColorDto? fillColor,
    SpacingDto? contentPadding,
  }) {
    return builder(
      InputDecorationSpecAttribute(
        border: border,
        filled: filled,
        fillColor: fillColor,
        contentPadding: contentPadding,
      ),
    );
  }

  late final fillColor = ColorUtility((color) => only(fillColor: color));

  late final filled = BoolUtility((boolean) => only(filled: boolean));

  late final contentPadding =
      SpacingUtility((spacing) => only(contentPadding: spacing));

  T border(InputBorder inputBorder) => only(border: inputBorder);
}

```

The `InputDecorationUtility` is a class that extends `SpecUtility` and has methods to create the `InputDecorationSpecAttribute` with the attributes of the `InputDecoration`. The awesome thing about it is that each pre-defined Utility has some facilities to use the attributes, for example, the `filled` returns a `BoolUtility` that comes with `on` and `off` methods to make more readable the code, or the `fillColor` that returns a `ColorUtility` that comes with a bunch of methods to make it easier to use the `Color` attributes and do operations with them.

To finish, you can create a variable to use the `InputDecorationUtility`, like this:

```dart
final $inputDecoration = InputDecorationUtility(MixUtility.selfBuilder);
```

So you can write the `Style` like this:

```dart
final style = Style(
    $inputDecoration.border(
        OutlineInputBorder(
        borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20),
        borderSide: BorderSide.none,
        ),
    ),
    $inputDecoration.filled.on(),
    $inputDecoration.fillColor.,
    $inputDecoration.contentPadding.all(24),
    $with.scale(2),
);
```
