# How to create animation using Mix

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create animations using Mix. First, we need to understand how Mix styles work. All the stylizations begin with the `Style` class. 

## Style class
The `Style` class is a container for all the stylizations that you want to apply to a widget. You can add multiple stylizations to a `Style` object, and then apply it to a widget. As example, we will create a red rounded container.
    
```dart
Box(
    style: Style(
        height(50),
        width(50),
        backgroundColor(Colors.red),
        borderRadius(10),
    ),
);
```

At this point, we have a red rounded container. If you have any experience with Mix it's not new to you. Now, let's see how we can animate this container.

## AnimatedStyle class
The `AnimatedStyle` is a subclass of `Style` that allows you to animate the stylizations based on differences between two `Style` objects, that could be applied using variants. To show how it works, let's create a simple animation that changes the color and size of the container when the user taps on it.

```dart
PressableBox(
    onPress: () => {
        // Do something...
    },
    child: Box(
        style: AnimatedStyle(
            Style(
                height(50),
                width(50),
                backgroundColor(Colors.blue),
                borderRadius(10),
                onHover(
                    height(100),
                    width(100),
                    backgroundColor(Colors.red),
                ),
            ),
            duration: Durations.long1,
            curve: Curves.decelerate,
        ),
    ),
);
```

Note that different from the `Style` class, the `AnimatedStyle` class receives besides the style, the `duration` and `curve` parameters. The `duration` parameter is the time that the animation will take to complete, and the `curve` parameter is the curve that the animation will follow. 

## Start point and end point
A important thing to keep in mind is that animations will only work if you define a start point for each attribute. If you don't define a start point, the animation will not work.

### Don't 
In the example below, the animation will not work because we didn't define a start point for the `backgroundColor` attribute.

```dart
PressableBox(
    onPress: () => {
        // Do something...
    },
    child: Box(
        style: AnimatedStyle(
            Style(
                height(50),
                width(50),
                onHover(
                    backgroundColor(Colors.blue),
                ),
            ),
            duration: Durations.long1,
            curve: Curves.decelerate,
        ),
    ),
);
```

### Do 
Different from the previous example, the animation will work because we defined a start point for the `backgroundColor` attribute.

```dart
PressableBox(
    onPress: () => {
        // Do something...
    },
    child: Box(
        style: AnimatedStyle(
            Style(
                height(50),
                width(50),
                backgroundColor(Colors.red),
                onHover(
                    backgroundColor(Colors.blue),
                ),
            ),
            duration: Durations.long1,
            curve: Curves.decelerate,
        ),
    ),
);
```
