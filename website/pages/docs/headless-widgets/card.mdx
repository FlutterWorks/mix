# Card

Cards are surfaces that display content and actions on a single topic.

They should be easy to scan for relevant and actionable information. Elements, 
like text and images, should be placed on them in a way that clearly indicates 
hierarchy.

It takes a list of widgets as the children displayed vertically

```dart
CardX(
  children: [
    const TextMix(
      'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur',
      variant: title,
    ),
    const TextMix(
      'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.'
      ' Sed hendrerit risus a neque maximus, non viverra',
      variant: paragraph,
    ),
  ],
)
```
