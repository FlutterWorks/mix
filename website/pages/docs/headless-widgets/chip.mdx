# Chip

Chips are compact elements that represent an input, attribute, or action. They 
allow users to enter information, make selections, filter content, or trigger 
actions.

```dart
ChipX(
  children: const [IconMix(icon: Icons.add), TextMix('Lorem')],
  onPressed: () => debugPrint('ChipX pressed'),
),
```
