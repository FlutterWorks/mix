# Alert Dialog

Alerts are urgent interruptions, requiring acknowledgement, that inform the user about a 
situation. They can be displayed using the `showDialog` function, provided by the Flutter
Framework.

They can take `content` and `actions`. The `title` and `paragraph` variants are used to
customize the style of both texts.

```dart
final dialog = AlertDialogX(
  content: <Widget>[
    const TextMix(
      'Are you absolutely sure?', 
      variant: title, // `title` variant used to style the TextMix as title
    ),
    const TextMix(
      'This action cannot be undone. '
      'This will permanently delete your account and remove '
      'your data from our servers.',
      variant: paragraph, // `paragraph` variant to style the TextMix as 
    ),
  ],
  actions: <Widget>[
    // your buttons come here
  ],
);

showDialog(
  context: context,
  builder: (context) => dialog,
);
```
