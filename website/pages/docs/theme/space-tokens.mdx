# Space Tokens

When using spacing in your `Mix`, you'll often use the `padding` and `margin` attributes. To add consistency into your app, it's good to have the same spacing around it. For that, you can use space tokens.

![Overlay of 16 dp margins on 360 dp breakpoint app screen](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zs_TXfpOmkPDHRzVllD9ddlI4gVfLRGTV7qS4sBW0sE0Wer3RUgT6dClsKcVlRyNBY2cCDfd65OzPI7FqjsUzFvtxO8NmivYjFOOrg=w1064-v0)

Each card above has a margin of 16px horizontally, which can be achieved like the following:

```dart
final mix = Mix(
  marginHorizontal.large,
);
```

## Acessing the tokens globally

The space tokens can be accessed by using `$space`:

```dart
final mix = Mix(
  height($space.medium), // height of 8px
);
```

## Customizing spaces

You can define your space tokens in your `MixThemeData`, like the following:

```dart
MixTheme(
  data: MixThemeData(
    space: MixThemeSpace(
      large: 16.0, // 16px
    ),
  ),
  child: ..;,
);
```

Now, when you call, `padding.large`, for example, you'll have a padding of 16px on all sides of the box.
