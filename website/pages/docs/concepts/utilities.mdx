# Utilities Fundamentals

Mix Utilities are essential tools for effortlessly styling Flutter widgets. They provide a streamlined and semantic approach to defining and applying style attributes, offering an intuitive and efficient styling experience. Designed as flexible classes that mimic method functionalities, Mix Utilities enable precise and granular control over widget aesthetics, enhancing both the functionality and elegance of your UI designs.

## Purpose of Utilities

- Semantic Consistency: Apply styles to widgets in a way that's both meaningful and easy to understand.
- Increased Efficiency: Simplify your code and increase maintenance, allowing for faster and more streamlined development.
- Enhanced Control: Gain more control over styling, composability, and integration of design tokens.

## Descriptive Styling

Utilities are designed to be descriptive and easy to understand. This makes it easy to know what each utility does and how to use it.

```dart
final style = Style(
  width(100),
  padding(10),
  alignment.center(),
  background.color.red(),
);
```

## Intuitive API design

A utility is a class that mimics the functionality of a method. This allows you to use utilities in a way that feels natural and intuitive. As there are many ways to use an utility to achieve the same result, normally they are done for different purposes, but they all achieve the same result, and you can use the one that makes more sense for you.

```dart
// Chaining style is the most common way to use utilities.
box.alignment.center();

// As this seems similar to the above, this allows you to pass an `Alignment` as a parameter.
box.alignment(Alignment.center);

// Gives you direct control over the `x` and `y` values of an `Alignment` object.
box.alignment.only(x: 0.0, y: 0.0);
```

## Utility Aliases

Aliases are utilities that are meant to be used as a shorthand for other utilities, or provide a shortcut to a nested utility path.

### Example

`border` is an alias to `box.border` which itself is an alias to `box.decoration.border`. This allows you to use `border` instead of `box.decoration.border` to apply a border to a widget.

```dart
// A utility to define a box border.
border.color.red();

// The same as
box.decoration.border.color.red();
```

### Creating aliases

If you want to create your own short hand utilities you can just assign the
utility to a variable. For example:

```dart
// Custom alias for border top styling
final bt = border.top;

// As a method
bt.color.red();

// As a paramter
bt(color: Colors.red);
```

You can also create aliases for specific values of a utility. For example:

```dart
// Custom alias for alignment.center
final borderRedTop = border.top.color.red;

// Usage
borderRedTop();
```
