# Style Variants

Variants are powerful tools in Mix, designed to streamline the styling process in Flutter applications. They allow for the grouping and conditional application of styling attributes, enhancing efficiency and adaptability in UI design.

## Overview

The `Variant` API is designed to be simple and intuitive. There are two types of variants.

- **Named variants** are applied manually, and can be used to create custom variants.
- **Context variants** are applied automatically, and can be used to create responsive variants.

Variants usage can be broken down in two main parts. The definition of a `Variant`, and the application of the variant within a `Style`.

## Named Variants

Named variants are important when you want to have a very clear control of when a variant can be used, and want to control the over the variant usage and type.

### Defining a Variant

To define a variant, you can use the `Variant` constructor.

```dart
const outlined = Variant('outlined');
```

### Using a Variant in a Style

To use a variant in a style, you can call it as a function on a `Style` passing the attributes.

```dart {1, 8-12}
const outlined = Variant('outlined');

final style = Style(
  padding(20),
  border.radius(10),
  backgroundColor.black(),
  text.style.color.white(),
  outlined(
    backgroundColor.transparent(),
    border.color.black(),
    text.style.color.black(),
  ),
);
```

### Applying a Variant

To apply a variant, you can use the `variant` method on a `Style`.

```dart {1, 8-12, 15}
const outlined = Variant('outlined');

final style = Style(
  padding(20),
  border.radius(10),
  backgroundColor.black(),
  text.style.color.white(),
  outlined(
    backgroundColor.transparent(),
    border.color.black(),
    text.style.color.black(),
  ),
);

final outlinedStyle = style.variant(outlined);
```

`outlinedStyle` will now have the attributes defined in the `outlined` variant, and will be equivalent to the following:

```dart highlight="2-4"
final outlinedStyle = Style(
  padding(20),
  border.radius(10),
  backgroundColor.transparent(),
  border.color.black(),
  text.style.color.black(),
);
```

## Context Variants

Context variants are variants that are applied automatically based on the BuildContext. They are useful when you want to create responsive variants that are applied automatically based on the context.

### Defining a Context Variant

To define a context variant, you can use the `ContextVariant` constructor and pass a `when` function.

```dart
final onDark = ContextVariant(
  'on-dark',
  (context) => Theme.of(context).brightness == Brightness.dark;
);
```

<Callout type="info">
  Defining the name of a context variant with `on` is a convention, but not a
  requirement. That helps identify that this is a `ContextVariant`.
</Callout>

### Using a Context Variant in a Style

To use a context variant in a style, you can call it as a function on a `Style` passing the attributes.

```dart {7-10}

final style = Style(
  padding(20),
  border.radius(10),
  backgroundColor.black(),
  text.style.color.white(),
  onDark(
    backgroundColor.white(),
    text.style.color.black(),
  ),
);
```

### Applying a Context Variant

`ContextVariants` are applied automatically based on the `BuildContext`. Once it is called on a style it will be equivalent to have defined the following:

```dart highlight="2-4"
final onDarkStyle = Style(
  padding(20),
  border.radius(10),
  backgroundColor.white(),
  text.style.color.black(),
);
```

## Conditional operators

The operators `|` and `&` can be used to add conditions to your mix:

- `|`: whether one of the variants apply

```dart highlight="3-7"
final style = Style(
  padding(20),
  (onSmall | onMedium)( // Whether it's small OR medium
    width(300),
    height(400),
    backgroundColor(Colors.white),
  ),
);
```

- `&`: when all of the variants apply

```dart highlight="3-6"
final mix = Style(
  padding(20.0),
  (onHover & onPress)( // When it's hovering AND pressing
    text.style(color: Colors.black),
    bold(),
  ),
);
```

The `onNot` operator can also be called to execute the variant content only when the given
variant is not called. For example:

```dart highlight="2-4"
final style = Style(
  onNot(disabled)(
    scale(1.2),
  ),
);
```

## Variants catalog

Mix already has some `Reactive Variants` defined which can be used to create responsive
Widgets.

### Pressable

These are `Variants` that will change based on different _gestures_ and state of the
`Pressable` Widget.

- `onHover()`: Applies attributes on hover.
- `onFocus()`: Applies attributes on focus.
- `onPress()`: Applies attributes when pressing.
- `onDisabled()`: Applies attributes when disabled.

### Breakpoints

- `onSmall()`: Applies attributes when the screen is at least `small` breakpoint.
- `onMedium()`: Applies attributes when the screen is at least `medium` breakpoint.
- `onLarge()`: Applies attributes when the screen is at least `large` breakpoint.

Breakpoints for these sizes can be configured in the `MixTheme`:

### Orientation

- `onPortrait()`: Applies attributes when the screen is in portrait orientation.
- `onLandscape()`: Applies attributes when the screen is in landscape orientation.

### Dark Mode

- `onDark()`: Applies attributes when the theme is in dark mode.
- `onLight()`: Applies attributes when the theme is in light mode.

### State Holding

- `onActive()`: Applies attributes when the widget state is marked as active
- `onInactive()`: Applies attributes when the widget state is marked as inactive
