# Variants

While building your design system you will find have the need to create certain variations
of a Widget. This makes the design system more flexible and reusable, by leveraging shared
visual properties between them.

In the following example `hover()` is a `Variant` that will be applied when a `Pressable`
triggers the hover state. The `backgroundColor` and `textColor` properties will be overridden with the new value when the variant applies

```dart highlight="10-13"
final style = StyleMix(
  backgroundColor(MaterialTokens.colorScheme.primary),
  textStyle(color: $onPrimary),
  hover(
    backgroundColor(MaterialTokens.colorScheme.primary),
    textStyle(color: $onPrimary),
  ),
);

Pressable(
  style: style,
  child: const TextMix('Button'),
);
```

Variants can be extremely powerful, and allow you to create consistent variations of your
Widgets.

## Usage

To use a variant, call it on a _Mix_

```dart
final mix = StyleMix(
  dark(
    textStyle(color: Colors.white),
  ),
  light(
    textStyle(color: Colors.black),
  ),
);
```

### Conditional operators

The operators `|` and `&` can be used to add conditions to your mix:

- `|`: whether one of the variants apply

```dart highlight="3-7"
final mix = StyleMix(
  padding(20.0),
  (small | medium)( // Whether it's small OR medium
    width(300),
    height(400),
    backgroundColor(Colors.white),
  ),
);
```

- `&`: when all of the variants apply

```dart highlight="3-6"
final mix = StyleMix(
  padding(20.0),
  (hover & press)( // When it's hovering AND pressing
    textStyle(color: Colors.black),
    bold(),
  ),
);
```

The `not` operator can also be called to execute the variant content only when the given
variant is not called. For example:

```dart highlight="2-4"
final mix = StyleMix(
  (not(disabled))(
    scale(1.2),
  ),
);
```

### Conditional variants

The `when` variant lets you concisely evaluate expressions within a mix or a within variant list.

```dart highlight="5-7"
bool hasError = true;

final mix = StyleMix(
  backgroundColor(Colors.green),
  when(hasError)(
    backgroundColor(Colors.red),
  ),
);
```

If the `hasError` condition is true, the attributes inside the statement are applied and, if necessary, will override previous attributes.
To ensure specific control over the flow, you can use the else statement by adding another statement right after it:

```dart highlight="4-8"
bool hasError = true;

final mix = StyleMix(
  when(hasError)(
    backgroundColor(Colors.red),
  )(
    // will be executed if `hasError` is false
    backgroundColor(Colors.green),
  ),
);
```

## Variants catalog

Mix already has some `Reactive Variants` defined which can be used to create responsive
Widgets.

### Pressable

These are `Variants` that will change based on different _gestures_ and state of the
`Pressable` Widget.

- `hover()`: Applies attributes on hover.
- `focus()`: Applies attributes on focus.
- `press()`: Applies attributes when pressing.
- `disabled()`: Applies attributes when disabled.

### Breakpoints

- `small()`: Applies attributes when the screen is at least `small` breakpoint.
- `medium()`: Applies attributes when the screen is at least `medium` breakpoint.
- `large()`: Applies attributes when the screen is at least `large` breakpoint.

Breakpoints for these sizes can be configured in the `MixTheme`:

```dart
MixTheme(
  data: MixThemeData(
    breakpoints: MixThemeBreakpoints(
      small: 600, // cellphone
      medium: 1240, // tablet
      large: 1440, // desktop
    ),
  ),
  child: ...,
),
```

### Orientation

- `portrait()`: Applies attributes when the screen is in portrait orientation.
- `landscape()`: Applies attributes when the screen is in landscape orientation.

### Dark Mode

- `dark()`: Applies attributes when the theme is in dark mode.
- `light()`: Applies attributes when the theme is in light mode.

### State Holding

- `active()`: Applies attributes when the widget state is marked as active
- `inactive()`: Applies attributes when the widget state is marked as inactive

### Text Styling

For widgets such as Dialogs, Cards and Modals, it's good to have titles and content.

- `title()`: Applies attributes when the `TextMix` is marked as title
- `paragraph()`: Applies attributes when the `TextMix` is marked as paragraph

```dart highlight="2-7"
final mix = StyleMix(
  title(
    titleCase(), // Makes the title uppercase
    font(
      weight: FontWeight.bold, // Makes the title bold
    ),
  ),
);
```

All other texts that are not marked as `title` will not be touched.

## Custom Variants

Mix gives you complete control of how to define your own `Variants` and when they are
applied.

There are two types of `Variants` that you are able to define: callable and context
variants.

### Callable Variants

Can be called manually when they need to be applied. You can define a variant the following
way.

```dart highlight="6-10"
const outlined = Variant('outlined');

final mix = StyleMix(
  backgroundColor(Colors.black),
  textStyle(color: Colors.white),
  outlined(
    backgroundColor(Colors.transparent),
    borderColor(Colors.black),
    textStyle(color: Colors.black),
  ),
);
```

You are then able to choose when to apply the variant based on your own logic.

```dart highlight="2"
Pressable(
  style: mix.withVariant(outlined),
  onPressed: () {},
  child: const TextMix('Outlined Button'),
);
```

You are also able to pass the variant through the `variant` parameter on the
`MixableWidget` constructor

```dart highlight="3"
Pressable(
  style: mix,
  variant: outlined,
  onPressed: () {},
  child: const TextMix('Outlined Button'),
);

```

### Context Variants

These are `Variants` that have a method that defines when they should be applied based on
the `BuildContext`. These will be applied automatically.

Here is an example implementation of the `dark()` to understand how it works.

```dart highlight="3-5"
final dark = Variant(
  'dark',
  shouldApply: (BuildContext context) {
    return Theme.of(context).brightness == Brightness.dark;
  },
);
```
