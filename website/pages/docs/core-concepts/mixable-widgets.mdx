## Mixable Widgets

`package:mix/mix.dart` defines a set of widget primitives that can use _Mix_ `Attributes` and allow them to be rendered with those `Attributes`.

At first glance it might seem these widgets are doing a lot &mdash; in reality, they are simply wrapping basic _Flutter_ widgets and allowing their visual properties to be defined through a _Mix._

The fundamental widget primitive defined in _Mix_ is a `Box`. A `Box` can contain other widgets and a set of `BoxAttributes` to define it's visual properties.

> An easy misconception would be to think that `Box` is **like** a `Container`, but that would be incorrect: `Box` **is** a `Container`.

That means that this:

```dart
Box(mix: Mix(height(100)));
```

will become the following:

```dart
Container(height: 100);
```

You can think of `Utilities` as shortcuts to defining visual properties. Thus:

```dart
Box(mix: Mix(rounded(100)));
```

will become the following:

```dart
Container(
  decoration: BoxDecoration(
    borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(100),
  ),
)
```

## Mixable catalog

Built-in mixable widgets that you can use right-away in your app.

### Box

`Box` is, basically, a `Container`. A mixable that will usually be the base widget to create most of your layouts.

```dart
Box(
  mix: Mix(
    height(100),
    width(300),
    rounded(15),
    bgColor(Colors.amber),
    align(Alignment.center),
    elevation(4), // can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 24
  ),
),
```

### FlexBox

A flex box is a widget that takes a list of children and displays them according to its `axis`.

```dart
FlexBox(
  mix: Mix(gap(6.0)),
  axis: Axis.horizontal,
  children: [
    IconMix(icon: Icons.search),
    TextMix('Click to search'),
  ],
)
```

#### HBox and VBox

`HBox` and `VBox` are helper widgets that are, basically, a `FlexBox` under the hood. `axis` is, respectively, `Axis.horizontal` and `Axis.vertical`

```dart
Hbox(
  mix: Mix(gap(6)),
  children: [
    Image.fromAsset('assets/bahamas.png'),
    VBox(
      children: [
        TextMix('The Bahamas', variant: title),
        TextMix("""The Bahamas, known officially as the Commonwealth of The Bahamas, 
is a sovereign country within the Lucayan Archipelago of the West Indies in the Atlantic. 
It takes up 97% of the Lucayan Archipelago's land area and is home to 88% of the archipelago's 
population. The archipelagic state consists of more than 700 islands, cays, and islets in the 
Atlantic Ocean, and is located north of Cuba and northwest of the island of Hispaniola (split 
between Haiti and the Dominican Republic) and the Turks and Caicos Islands, southeast of the 
American state of Florida, and east of the Florida Keys. The capital is Nassau on the island of 
New Providence. The Royal Bahamas Defence Force describes The Bahamas' territory as encompassing 
470,000 km2 (180,000 sq mi) of ocean space.""", variant: paragraph),
      ],
    ),
  ],
),
```

### IconMix

It's capable of displaying icons and inherit data from parent mixes

```dart
IconMix(
  mix: Mix(
    iconSize(30),
    iconColor(Colors.grey),
  ),
  icon: Icons.add,
),
```

### Pressable

A `Pressable` is a mixable widget that can provide the following information for its descendants:

* hovering
* pressing
* disabled
* focused

Here's how you can create a text button with it:

```dart
Pressable(
  onPressed: () => debugPrint('my awesome button was pressed'),
  child: Box(
    mix: Mix(
      // when nothing's happening, bg color is the default grey
      bgColor(Colors.grey),
      (hover)(
        // when hovering, bg color is a lighter grey
        bgColor(Colors.grey.shade300),
      ),
      (press)(
        // when pressing, bg color is a darker grey
        bgColor(Colors.grey.shade600),
      ),
      rounded(8),
      padding(10),
      alignment(Alignment.center),
    ),
    child: TextMix(
      'PRESS ME',
      mix: Mix(
        fontSize(18.0),
        (disabled)(
          textColor(Colors.grey.shade900),
        ),
        textColor(Colors.black),
        bold(),
      ),
    ),
  ),
),
```

### TextMix

It's capable of rendering text and inherit data from parent mixes

```dart
TextMix(
  'Mix is AWESOME!'
  mix: Mix(
    fontSize(16.0),
    textColor(Colors.black),
    bold(),
    textShadow(
      offset: const Offset(2.0, 2.0),
    ),
  ),
),
```
