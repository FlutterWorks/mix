## Attributes

`Attributes` are the foundation for visual characteristics and properties that can be defined and added to a _Mix_.

In _Flutter_ we say:

> Everything is a widget

In _Mix_, we say:

> Everything is an Attribute

**Note: A _Mix_ is an object that contains a collection of `Attributes`.**

### Utilities

To facilitate interacting with `Attributes`, we use `Utility` functions. These functions allow more control over how an attribute is composed.

Consider the following example:

```dart
Mix(height(100));
```

This defines a _Mix_ with the box height attribute of _100_.
The function `height()` is a `Utility` that allows us to compose an `Attribute`.

With that in mind you can think that

```dart
Mix(height(100))
```

is equivalent to

```dart
Mix(BoxAttribute(height: 100))
```

As you can see, `Utilities` are not required for composing _Mixes_. However, they make a cleaner API possible, and an overall better development experience.
