# Attributes

`Attributes` are the foundation for visual characteristics and properties that can be defined and added to a _Mix_.

In _Flutter_ we say:

<Callout emoji="ðŸ›¹">
  Everything is a Widget
</Callout>

In _Mix_, we say:

<Callout>
  Everything is an Attribute
</Callout>

**Note: A _Mix_ is an object that contains a collection of `Attributes`.**

## Utilities

To facilitate interacting with `Attributes`, we use `Utility` functions. These functions allow more control over how an attribute is composed.

Consider the following example:

```dart
Mix(height(100));
```

This defines a _Mix_ with the box height attribute of _100_.
The function `height()` is a `Utility` that allows us to compose an `Attribute`.

With that in mind you can think that

```dart
Mix(height(100))
```

is equivalent to

```dart
Mix(BoxAttribute(height: 100))
```

As you can see, `Utilities` are not required for composing _Mixes_. However, they make a cleaner API possible, and an overall better development experience.

## Directives

Directives are _Attributes_ that define a transformation that needs to happen within the widget during build time. A great example of this would be the `TextDirective` which allow to define the text case, for your `TextMix` widget.

```dart highlight="2"
final style = Mix(
  upperCase(),
);

const TextMix('Open', mix: style),
```

In the above example, the text `Open` becomes `OPEN`. Currently, Directives only apply to text

### Directives catalog
