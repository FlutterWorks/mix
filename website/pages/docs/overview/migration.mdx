# Migration Guide

## 0.0.7 to 1.0.0

In our pursuit of API usability and efficiency, we introduced several deprecations in the latest Mix Package versions. When encountering issues not covered by deprecation notices, please [open an issue or send a PR to our deprecation file](https://github.com/conceptadev/mix/blob/main/lib/src/deprecations.dart).

### Deprecations

The major updates are:

#### `Mix` evolve to `Style`
The `Mix` class is now `Style`. Several methods in the renamed class, including `withVariants`, `withMaybeVariants` among others, are deprecated to boost performance and reduce potential confusion.

| before 1.0.0 | 1.0.0 |
| ------- | ------ |
| `Mix`   | `Style` |
| `Mix.withVariant` | `Style.applyVariant` |
| `Mix.withManyVariants` | `Style.applyVariants` |
| `withMaybeVariant` or `withMaybeVariants` | removed |


Another important change is that the `Style` doesn't contain generic type anymore. Therefore, in the new version it is no longer possible.

#### `MixContextBuilder` was renamed to `SpecBuilder`
The `MixContextBuilder` was renamed to `SpecBuilder` to better reflect its purpose. The `MixContextBuilder` is now deprecated.

#### Widget Updates

`TextMix` and `IconMix` widgets are deprecated. Use `StyledText` and `StyledIcon` respectively.

#### Short Aliases

To enhance readability, short aliases and shorthand property/method names are replaced with fully named counterparts. You can find the full list of removed aliases in the [deprecations file](https://github.com/conceptadev/mix/blob/main/lib/src/deprecations.dart)

#### Decorators

Decorators' order was previously determined by their addition sequence. Now, we enforce specific ordering but also allow customizable orders. This might cause behavior changes in rare cases. For details, refer to the [decorators guide](https://fluttermix.com/docs/guides/decorators).

### StyledWidgets updates

#### The new PressableBox

To provide a more consistent way to use the gesture APIs, we developed a new widget that merges the functionalities of `Box` and `Pressable`. Thus, the new `PressableBox` can receive a style like a `Box` and also accept interactions and its variants, similar to a `Pressable`. For more information, see the [PressableBox guide](https://www.fluttermix.com/docs/widgets/pressable-box).
Keep in mind that the ideia is to reserve the old `Pressable` to more advanced cases.

### Behavior changes

#### Decorators

Decorators cannot be inherited by any children. The reason is that abstract class `Attribute` has gained a new property, `isInheritable`, which can be set to false if you want your custom attributes to be non-inheritable, such as Decorators.

#### Operators `and` (`&`) and `or` (`|`)

The operators have been redesigned to allow for concatenation and grouping, enabling the creation of conditions like, `(primary | secondary) & onHover`. For details, refer to the [variants guide](https://www.fluttermix.com/docs/guides/variants#combining-operators)

#### StyledWidgets and Decorators

A bunch of `StyledWidgets` are now allow to receive decorators' attributes, including `StyledIcon`, `StyledFlex` and `StyledIcon`. Additionally, when a decorator is not applied to a Style, a `RenderWidgetDecorators` will not be present in the widget tree. This simplification makes the widget easier to debug.

#### Theming

The `MixTheme` feature has been improved and now offer better API. It can applied to main attributes using the method `.of`, as shown in the following code:

```dart
const primaryColor = ColorToken('primary');
final theme = MixThemeData(
    colors: {
        primaryColor: Colors.blue,
    },
);

// ... body method ...
MixTheme(
    data: theme,
    Box(
        key: key,
        style: Style(
            $box.color.ref(primaryColor),
        ),
    )
)
```
### The use of $
In the 1.0.0 version, the `$` symbol is now used to access API from the Mix package. This change was made to be easier to identify the utilities provided by Mix. For example, to access the `box` namespace, you should use `$box`.

| before 1.0.0 | 1.0.0 |
| ------- | ------ |
| `box`   | `$box` |
| `text`  | `$text` |
| `icon`  | `$icon` |
| `image`  | `$image` |
| `flex`  | `$flex` |
| `stack` | `$stack` |

#### The new Namespaces `$on` and `$with`

Two new namespaces were added to the Mix package: `$on` and `$with`. The `$on` namespace is used to access ContextVariants, like `$on.hover`, `$on.focus`, and `$on.press`. While the `$with` namespace is used to access all the decorators provided by Mix. 

```dart
PressableBox(
    onPress: () {},
    style: Style(
        $box.width(200),
        $box.height(200),
        $box.color.blue(),

        $with.scale(2), // <-- Decorator
        $with.opacity(0.5),
        
        $on.hover( // <-- ContextVariant
            $box.color.red(),
        ),
        $on.press(
            $box.color.green(),
        ),
    ),
    child: Box(),
)

```
