# Introduction

To support the Mix framework's design principles, the Mix package provides a set of widgets that extend Flutter's core functionality with additional features and utilities. These widgets are called **StyledWidgets**. They are designed to be flexible, style-friendly, and easy to use, allowing you to build custom-styled components with ease. 

## What are StyledWidgets?
They are a set of widgets that are able to receive a `Style` object as a parameter. This object contains a set of attributes that will be applied to the widget, such as color, padding, margin, and more. The most common StyledWidget is `Box`, which is equivalent to Flutter's `Container`.

# StyledWidgets available in Mix
## `Box`
As already mentioned, the `Box` widget is equivalent to Flutter's `Container`. You can read more about it [here](/website/pages/docs/widgets/box.mdx).

```dart
Box(
    style: Style(
        $box.width(100),
        $box.height(100),
        $box.backgroundColor(Colors.blue),
    )
)
```

## `PressableBox`
The `PressableBox` widget is merge between a `Container` and `GestureDetector`. It allows you to add some interaction to your `Box` widget, and use variants like `onPress`, and `onLongPress`. You can read more about it [here](/website/pages/docs/widgets/pressable-box.mdx).

```dart
PressableBox(
    onPress: () => {// Do something},
    style: Style(
    $box.color.blue(),
    $box.width(100),
    $box.height(100),
    ),
    child: // <- Enter the child parameter,
)
```

## `StyledText`
It's a widget that can apply text styles to a `Text` widget. You can read more about it [here](/website/pages/docs/widgets/text.mdx).

```dart
StyledText(
    'Hello, World!',
    style: Style(
        $text.style.color(Colors.blue),
        $text.style.fontSize(20),
    )
)
```

## `StyledIcon`
StyledIcon's a widget equivalent to an `Icon` widget. You can read more about it [here](/website/pages/docs/widgets/icon.mdx).

```dart
StyledIcon(
    Icons.ac_unit,
    style: Style(
        $icon.color(Colors.blue),
        $icon.size(30),
    )
)
```

## `StyleImage`
It's a widget that can apply styles to an `Image` widget. You can read more about it [here](/website/pages/docs/widgets/image.mdx).

```dart
StyledImage(
    style: Style(
        $box.color.blue(),
        $flex.direction.horizontal(),
        $flex.mainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween(),
    ),
    image: // <-- Enter the ImageProvider here,
)
```

## `FlexBox`, `HBox` and `VBox`
These are equivalent to the `Flex`, `Row` and `Column` widget in Flutter. Everything you are able to do with the `Box` widget, you are able to do with `FlexBox`, `HBox` and `VBox`. However, the main difference is that you can specify flex attributes to it. You can read more about it [here](/website/pages/docs/widgets/flex.mdx).

```dart
FlexBox(
    direction: Axis.horizontal,
    style: Style(
        $box.color.blue(),
        $flex.direction.horizontal(),
        $flex.mainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween(),
    ),
    children: [
        Box(
        child: Text('Box 1'),
        ),
        Box(
        child: Text('Box 2'),
        ),
        Box(
        child: Text('Box 3'),
        ),
    ],
)
```

## `ZBox`
This is a widget that allows you to layout widgets like a `Stack` widget. You can read more about it [here](/website/pages/docs/widgets/stack.mdx).

```dart
ZBox(
    style: Style(
        $stack.alignment.centerLeft(),
        $box.width(200),
        $box.height(200),
    ),
    children: [
        Container(
        color: Colors.red,
        width: 100,
        height: 100,
        ),
        Container(
        color: Colors.blue,
        width: 50,
        height: 50,
        ),
    ],
)
```
