# Getting Started

## Installation

Just run the following command to add Mix in your project.

```bash
flutter pub add mix
```

## Usage

Here is a simple example of defining and using a Mix to get started.

**Rounded Purple Box with Elevation and White Text**

```dart

import 'package:mix/mix.dart';

final mix = Mix(
    height(100),
    width(100),
    rounded(10),
    elevation(2),
    bgColor(Colors.purple),
    align(Alignment.center),
    textColor(Colors.white),
);

Box(
    mix: mix,
    child: TextMix('Purple Box'),
);

```

**Results**

## Mixing

You will compose visual attributes using **Mixes**. This allows you to compose, combine, inherit and override visual attributes. If you come from the web you can think of a Mix as a stylesheet. That allows to group visual attributes.

### Creating a Mix

#### Mix

You can create a Mix by calling it's class and passing positional attributes like so

```dart

final mix = Mix(
    height(100),
    width(100),
    bgColor(Colors.purple),
    rounded(10),
);

```

#### Mix.fromList()

Allows you to create a Mix from a List of attributes. This has the same behavior but provides the ability to receive a List instead of positional arguments.

```dart
final mix = Mix.fromList([
    height(100),
    width(100),
    bgColor(Colors.purple),
    rounded(10),
]);
```

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
  The order of the attributes is important, and keep in mind when composing and
  overriding them. Attributes will be prioritized from right to left.
</Callout>

### Extending a Mix

Mixes are immutable. The new Mix created will inherit all attributes of the original.

#### Adding attributes to a Mix

##### .add

If you have an existing Mix you can add attributes to it by calling the `add` method. This will return a new Mix with the new attributes added.

```dart
final newMix = mix.add(
    height(200),
    width(200),
    bgColor(Colors.red),
);
```

##### .addAll

Similar to `add` but allows you to pass a List of attributes.

```dart
final newMix = mix.addAll([
    height(200),
    width(200),
    bgColor(Colors.red),
]);
```

#### Combining Mixes

Combining Mixes is a critical part of composing visual attributes. There are a few methods, and constructors that allow for easy ways to combine them.

##### .mix()

```dart
final thirdMix = firstMix.mix(secondMix);
```

##### .maybeMix()

If you are receiving a nullable Mix as a parameter there is a simple helper method to keep your code clean.

##### Mix.combine()

Creates a new Mix from a positional arguments of Mixes.

##### Mix.combineAll()

Creates a new Mix from a List of Mixes.

### Utility Helpers

##### Mix.chooser()

## Concepts

### Attributes & Utilities

Attributes are the foundation for characteristics or visual property, that can be defined and added to a Mix.

In Flutter we say "Everything is a widget", so for us "Everything in a Mix is an attribute".

To make interaction with `Attributes` easier we have `Utility` functions. That allow for more control over how an attribute is composed.

Lets take the following example.

```dart
Mix(height(100))
```

This is defining a Mix with the box height attribute of 100.
However **height** is a `Utility` that allows us to compose an `Attribute`.

**Similar to this**

```dart
BoxAttribute height(double value) => BoxAttribute(height: value);
```

With that in mind you can think of the following being equivalent.

```dart
Mix(height(100))
// is equivalent to
Mix(BoxAttribute(height: 100))
```

As you can see `Utilities` are not required for comsing Mixes however, make a cleaner API possible and overall better development experience.

### Mixer Widgets

The widget primitives that allow to render a Mix. They are the following:

#### Box

The most basic widget primitive. `Box` is not like a `Container`, Box is a Container". That means you can think of all `BoxAttributes` as `Container` properties.

That means that this:

```dart
Box(mix:Mix(height(100)));
```

will be translated into

```dart d
Container(height: 100);
```

#### Flexbox

The equivalent of the Flex widgets (Flex, Row, Column). Allow for the use of flex Attributes, and wrap them in a `Box` for composability.

#### HBox

Horizontal `Flexbox` widget. The equivalent of a `Row` in Flutter.

#### VBox

Vertical `Flexbox` widget. The equivalent of a `Column` in Flutter.

#### TextMix

The equivalent of the `Text` widget. Allows you to use Mix attributes to style and build custom text widgets.

#### IconMix

The equivalent to the `Icon` widget. Allows to use Mix attributes to style and build custom icon widgets.

### Variants
