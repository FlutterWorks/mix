The fundamental object that facilitates _Mixes_.

The instance can be used in [_Mixable Widgets_](./Mixable%20Widgets-topic.html)
to provide attributes to the widget.

Can be instantiated with two constructors:
- Constructor using positional arguments of attributes
- Constructor using a List of attributes

For either constructor, attributes are order dependent and are
applied from the last attribute specified to the first.
